PSX image processing library has no ducument, but I have made the code self-documenting. And a little knowledge about Photoshop is neccessory to better use this library, because every function in this library is corresponding to a Photoshop operation.

I'm a newbie in JS and ObjC. You are welcomed to give any refactor advise to improve this library.
Or you can join me, we'll together to make PSX a better open source image processing library for both javascript and ios developers.

Or if you just wanna use it in your project, go ahead please. PSX is MIT licensed.
If you like some effects which PSX has not implemented, Please feel free to contact me, I'll add the function as soon as possible.
